Basically this is my 11th project.
This  uses basic fucntions of python to create a set of cards.
there are totally 12 pairs and 1 single card in the set.
Where each set will have same special symbol behind them.
when two cards with same symbol match your score will be incrimantted.
And those two cards will be cleared.
When all the cards are revealed the game ends.
